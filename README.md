# 🎯 Target Strike: Motor Performance Detection using IoT with Motor Management App

## 🚀 Overview
Designed and deployed a motor management system using ESP32 and C++, integrating IoT, mobile apps, and predictive maintenance algorithms. Built a mobile app (Android Studio, Java) to scan QR codes and monitor motor health, reducing manual inspection time by 40%. The system utilizes sensors, mobile applications, and cloud technologies to streamline motor performance tracking.

## ✨ Features
- 🔲 **QR Code Generation**: Unique QR generated for each motors in the application itself.
- 🔍 **QR Code-Based Identification**: Unique QR codes for motor identification. 
- 📡 **Real-Time Monitoring**: Tracks temperature, vibration, and performance in real-time.
- ⚙️ **Predictive Maintenance**: Analyzes data patterns to predict potential motor issues.
- 🦺 **Motor Replacement**: The App gives location of similar moto incase of replacement. 
- 📲 **Mobile Integration**: Android app for easy access and control.

## 🛠️ Hardware Requirements
- 📡 **ESP32**
- 🌡️ **DHT11 Sensor** (Temperature & Humidity)
- 📈 **ADXL335 Sensor** (Vibration Detection)
- 🔋 **Power Supply**

## 🧑‍💻 Software Stack
- 🛠️ **Android Studio (Java & Kotlin)**
- ☁️ **Firebase (Cloud Storage & Real-Time Database)**
- 🖥️ **C++ (Firmware Development)**

## 🎮 How It Works
1. **Motor Registration & QR Code Generation**:  
   - When adding a new motor, a **QR code is generated** to replace the traditional steel plate details.

2. **Motor Identification & Data Retrieval**:  
   - Scanning the QR code retrieves the motor's details, eliminating manual record-keeping.

3. **Real-Time Sensor Data Display**:  
   - The app displays live **temperature and vibration data**, ensuring continuous monitoring.

4. **Quick Motor Replacement Assistance**:  
   - A **'Similar Motor' button** allows users to find identical motors for easy replacements.

5. **Comprehensive Performance Visualization**:  
   - Users can access both **real-time and historical data trends** for informed decision-making.

6. **Intelligent Predictive Maintenance Alerts**:  
   - The system **analyzes performance patterns** and sends alerts when potential issues are detected, helping prevent failures.
