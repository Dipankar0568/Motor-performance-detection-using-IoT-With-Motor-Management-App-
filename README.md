# 🎯 Target Strike: Motor Performance Detection using IoT with Motor Management App

## 🚀 Overview
Developed an IoT-based motor management system for real-time motor health monitoring and predictive maintenance. The system utilizes sensors, mobile applications, and cloud technologies to streamline motor performance tracking.

## 🤝 Contributors
- **Dipankar Bagade**

## ✨ Features
- 🔍 **QR Code-Based Identification**: Unique QR codes for motor identification.
- 📡 **Real-Time Monitoring**: Tracks temperature, vibration, and performance in real-time.
- ⚙️ **Predictive Maintenance**: Analyzes data patterns to predict potential motor issues.
- 📲 **Mobile Integration**: Android app for easy access and control.

## 🛠️ Hardware Requirements
- 📡 **ESP32**
- 🌡️ **DHT11 Sensor** (Temperature & Humidity)
- 📈 **ADXL335 Sensor** (Vibration Detection)
- 🔋 **Power Supply & Supporting Components**

## 🧑‍💻 Software Stack
- 🛠️ **Android Studio (Java & Kotlin)**
- ☁️ **Firebase (Cloud Storage & Real-Time Database)**
- 🖥️ **C++ (Firmware Development)**

## 🎮 How It Works
1. The mobile app scans a motor's **QR code** for identification.
2. The sensors gather and transmit performance data to **Firebase**.
3. The app visualizes **real-time and historical performance metrics**.
4. **Predictive maintenance alerts** are generated based on data trends.
